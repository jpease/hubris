## Design goals

> **wisdom**
> 
> noun. *to rig the game by defining your own measurement of best*

1. Homerow placement of most common English characters
2. Homerow placement of 0-9
3. Low same finger repetition
4. Low pinky workload
5. Inward rolls for a few common English bigrams (e.g. ea, ou, st, th)
6. Visually symmetrical layout

## Recommendations for the user

* **Use with an ergonomic keyboard.** I find this helps me keep things
    separate in my head. If I'm on a standard keyboard my brain defaults to
    QWERTY. If I'm on my Dactyl Manuform, or similar, I have a physical
    reminder I'm using Hubris.

## Evaluating characteristics

You may use [the KLA JSON file](hubris-v1-kla.json) in this repo to test the
layout and compare it to others using Keyboard Layout Analyzer. I happen to like
[this one](https://klatest.keyboard-design.com).
